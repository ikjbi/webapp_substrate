# webapp_substrate

Tried creating a python app with pysimplegui but realized that that framework doesn't support dynamic changing windows/ containers. 

I therefore decided to redo the program using HTML, CSS for front-end, and Javascript for talking to the backend that will be ran using python.

My plan is that Flask can create a local server that can run in the background.
